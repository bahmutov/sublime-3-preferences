# Sublime Text 3 preferences

To reuse these settings from Mac

* Your Sublime probably already created the default empty settings file
in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` folder
* `cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User && git init`
* Set this repo as the remote origin
`git remote add origin git@github.com:bahmutov/sublime-3-preferences.git`
* Pull latest settings file `git pull origin master`

The Sublime editor should pick up the settings and change the appearance.
